Inspired by [SqueezeAMP](https://github.com/philippe44/SqueezeAMP)  and [SqueezeAmpToo](https://github.com/rochuck/squeeze-amp-too)
with the goal of beeing able to order a SMD pre-placed PCB from JLCPCB

this is a work in progress

- Improve pinning (requires new config).
- If possible enable the use of a RP2040 based board
- If possible enable the use of a Raspberry pi
